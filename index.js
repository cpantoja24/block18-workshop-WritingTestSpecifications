// Unit Tests:
// 1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

    // Expect multiplication(x,y) to be a number
    // Expect multiplication(x,y) to be a product of two numbers
    // Expect multiplication(x,y) to have two arguments 
    // Expect multiplication(x,y) to return undefined if arguments are not numbers or only one number is provided


// 2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
// Example: concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1])
// ...should result in [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]
// Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the code should behave:
// What should happen with unexpected inputs?
// What kinds of unexpected inputs should we worry about?
// What should happen when there are multiples of the same odd number in the arrays? (Hint: We gave you the answer to this one in the example above.)

    // Expect concatOdds to be an array 
    // Expect concatOdds to take two arrays as arguments
    // Expect concatOdds to combine two arrays
    // Expect concatOdds to be odd numbers from both arrays
    // Expect concatOdds to be in ascending order
    // Expect concatOdds to only show one of each odd number
    // Expect concatOdds to return undefined if arguments are not arrays or there is only one array provided

// Functional Tests:
// 1. A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.
// Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the feature should behave:
// What should happen if the cart is empty?
// What needs to be shown to the user at each step of check out?
// What behaviors of this feature does the prompt miss or gloss over?
// Hint: Observe the shopping cart and checkout features of some popular websites to get some ideas!

    // When a user is checking out, they should be asked if they have an account or want to check out as a guest
    // When a user is checking out, they should be asked to sign into their account if they have one
    // When a user is checking out, they should be able to reset their password if they already have an account
    // When a user is checking out, they should be shown an incorrect information popup if the username and password are incorrect
    // When a user is checking out, they should be asked to if they want to create an account if they are checking out as a guest 
    // When a user is checking out, they should be prompted to add things to their cart if the cart is empty
    // When a user is checking out, they should be shown the items and quantities in their cart with the prices of each
    // When a user is checking out, thay should be shown to subtotal of the items in their cart
    // When a user is checking out, they should be shown the taxes of the items in their cart
    // When a user is checking out, they should be shown the deilvery fee of the items in their cart
    // When a user is checking out, they should be shown the total of their order
