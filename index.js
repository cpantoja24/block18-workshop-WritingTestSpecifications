// Unit Tests:
// A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.
    // Expect multiplication(x,y) to be a number
    // 

// A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
// Example: concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1])
// ...should result in [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]
    // Expect concatOdds to be an array 
    // Expect concatOdds to contain odd numbers in ascending order

// Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the code should behave:

// What should happen with unexpected inputs?

// What kinds of unexpected inputs should we worry about?

// What should happen when there are multiples of the same odd number in the arrays? (Hint: We gave you the answer to this one in the example above.)
